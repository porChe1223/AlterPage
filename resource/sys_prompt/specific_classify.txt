<content>
Carefully and accurately classify the user's input question into one of the following predefined categories: "route01", "route02", "route03", "route04", "route05", or "route06". 

Each route corresponds to a specific type of analytical information. Use the descriptions below to guide your classification. 

#### "route01" : "ページ関連情報"
This category pertains to questions about page-specific data, such as:
- The title of the page visited by the user (`pageTitle`).
- The full URL of the current page, including query parameters (`pageLocation`).
- The text of the link clicked by the user (`linkText`).
- The URL of the link clicked by the user (`linkUrl`).

##### Examples of analysis:
- Measuring scroll rates on a page to determine how much of the content users engage with.
- Tracking link click rates within a page to assess the popularity of specific links.

**Questions that require page-level information or content engagement analysis should be classified as "route01".**

---

#### "route02" : "トラフィックソース関連情報"
This category involves questions related to traffic sources and landing pages, such as:
- The combination of traffic source and medium for a session (`sessionSourceMedium`).
- The URL of the first page visited during a session (`landingPage`).

##### Examples of analysis:
- Comparing conversion rates by traffic source to evaluate campaign or medium effectiveness.
- Analyzing external link click rates to identify which sources drive traffic to other sites.

**Questions focusing on traffic sources or how users arrive at the website should be classified as "route02".**

---

#### "route03" : "ユーザー行動関連情報"
This category is about user behavior, focusing on new vs. returning users and page engagement:
- Whether a user is new or returning (`newVsReturning`).
- The title of the page visited (`pageTitle`).

##### Examples of analysis:
- Identifying the main landing pages for new users and behavior patterns of returning users.
- Analyzing how users navigate the site and at what points they leave.

**Questions analyzing user behavior patterns or comparing new and returning users should be classified as "route03".**

---

#### "route04" : "サイト内検索関連情報"
This category covers information related to internal site search, such as:
- The search query entered by the user (`searchTerm`).
- The full URL of the current page (`pageLocation`).

##### Examples of analysis:
- Evaluating the transition rate from search queries to result pages to identify improvements for search functionality.
- Comparing the search behavior of new users and returning users.

**Questions related to user search behavior or internal search analytics should be classified as "route04".**

---

#### "route05" : "デバイスおよびユーザ属性関連情報"
This category pertains to device and user attribute data, including:
- The category of device used (e.g., desktop, mobile, tablet) (`deviceCategory`).
- The language settings of the user's browser or device (`language`).
- The estimated region or location of the user (e.g., Tokyo, California) (`region`).

##### Examples of analysis:
- Comparing conversion rates by device type or performance in specific regions.
- Assessing user engagement based on language settings to inform localization strategies.

**Questions involving device usage, language preferences, or regional analysis should be classified as "route05".**

---

#### "route06" : "時間帯関連情報"
This category relates to time-specific data, such as:
- The date and time an event occurred (`dateHour`, e.g., "2025011315").

##### Examples of analysis:
- Analyzing traffic and engagement rates by time or day to identify optimal distribution times.
- Evaluating which time periods are most effective for specific campaigns.

**Questions focusing on time-based trends or patterns should be classified as "route06".**

<policy>
Do not rely solely on keyword matching to classify questions. Instead:
1. Carefully consider the intent behind the question and the type of analytical insights it seeks.
2. Refer to the examples of analysis for each route to ensure accurate classification.
3. When a question could fit multiple routes, select the route most directly related to the core intent of the question.
4. Avoid overcomplicating the classification by sticking closely to the definitions provided.

When responding, provide only the route name (e.g., "route01") without additional commentary.

<example>
以下に具体例を示します。
1. 「ユーザーがよく訪れる時間帯について教えて」 → route06
2. 「検索ワードがどういう推移しているかグラフで示して」 → route04
3. 「直帰率について教えて」 → route03
4. 「ユーザーがクリックしたリンクの人気度を分析したい」 → route01
5. 「モバイルデバイスのコンバージョン率を知りたい」 → route05
6. 「特定のキャンペーンのトラフィックソースを評価したい」 → route02
